# __Allien_invasion__
## Description

A simple game, implemented from scratch according to a Python tutorial. I've studied web development myself without any courses or training, so don't expect too much from the xD source code. 
Because of the differences in the code in the textbook, the background picture has been changed and the ship's movements "up" and "down" have been added.
